The files in this folder contain all the code needed for the CO monitor project.

Some of the data cleaning was performed in R, but the output of this code is saved onto the nickharbeck.com website. The R code is included for reference and does not need to be run before the models and GUI.

The preprocessing, models, and GUI are saved as one .py file. Each aspect of the report analysis is included in this code and the comments should help to clarify what each part of the code does.

To run the .py file, the windows.ui file needs to be in the same directory so the user interface works
